README File for test-responsive-img-gallery:

This is a test project, where my aims are to:

1. create an image gallery that is responsive and resizes according to the viewport size
2. create a lightbox slideshow as described below:
- upon clicking on an image thumbnail, a full size image will load as a modal, and the user has the ability to view the next or previous image like a slide show. 
- slideshow can be controlled by user clicking on arrows within the modal, or using keyboard arrows to slide forward or backwards.
- slideshow can be exited by user clicking on 'close' button or pressing 'ESC' on their keyboard.
